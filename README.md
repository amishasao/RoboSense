# RoboSense

A Novel Approach to Series Elastic Actuation in Neurorehabilitative Soft Robotics Using Resistance Pressure Sensors to Rotate Servo-Controlled Appendages Accurately

## About

A research project (now open-source!) that uses a semi-soft robotic glove for robotic rehab! For more info about the hardware components and 3D printing, please take a look at the Links section. If you're interested in the software and programming, keep reading!
